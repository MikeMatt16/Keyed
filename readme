Keyed is an Addon for World of Warcraft. 
It allows you to view the keystone of your friends, guild, party and alternate characters.
This Addon uses the 'Keyed Communication Library' that is currently under development.
This library allows Addons that utilize the library to share keyestones with anyone who is using an Addon with the library.
