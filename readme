Keyed is an Addon for World of Warcraft. 
It allows you to gather information about players in your guild, particularily what Mythic+ Keystones are in their inventory.
Members of the guild are to have this Addon installed, and the Addon will poll data when asked to. Information is shared
across the guild, so data will mostly stay in sync.

As far as this repo goes, there are 2 main Visual Studio projects: Keyed and Keyed Plus.
Keyed is a "C# Shared Project" type for simply containing the Addon code. Keyed Plus is a soon to-be desktop application
that allows you to view the guild's keystones and sychronize them with a web-server.

Add more to this readme later...
