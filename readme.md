# Keyed
### Keyed is an AddOn for World of Warcraft which allows you to browse the Mythic+ Keystones of your guild mates, party members, and friends.

## Setup
Have guild members and friends install the AddOn. It isn't possible for Keyed to "talk" to players who do not have the AddOn installed, so for them to show and update on the list, having the AddOn installed is a requirement.

## Commands
* `/keyed` will show the Keyed User Interface.
* `/keyed clear <db>` will clear the specified Keyed database. Specific options for this command are `guild`, `friends`, `characters`, or `all`
